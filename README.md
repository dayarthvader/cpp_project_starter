# cpp_project_starter  
Skeletal framework for a new c++ project.  
Details  
1. cpp source tree structure, designed based on my past projects. In principle, my projects are library oriented.
  Do review the source tree once to suite your architecture before forking the repo.  
  ```

- [] Update .clang-format as per google style guide
- [] Update Main CMakeLists.txt to provide basic skeleton
